<h3 align="center">Hey there! Thanks for visiting my profile! :wave:</h3>



About 3 years ago (in 2019), I registered at GitHub to fix a single bug. Yes, just a single bug in a [Minetest](https://minetest.net) [mod](https://github.com/shivajiva101/smartshop),\
and it has lead me to learn a lot about collaboration, open source, communication, and much more. ðŸš€

Currently, I'm an active open-source advocate and community moderator in **30+ communities**.
You can find me on various\
communities, such as [The Algorithms](https://the-algorithms.com), [Design & Code](https://www.designandcode.us/), [Devicon](https://devicon.dev), [WeMakeDevs](https://www.wemakedevs.org), [WebXDAO](https://webxdao.xyz/), and many more. ðŸ’»

I am always ready and open to work on new and challenging stuff. Whether it's about open-source, community management/moderation, coding stuff, I can do it!\
I can be working on 5+ projects at the same time without getting stressed. After all, it's something fun that I like to do that benefits other people. It benefits the community: it benefits open-source.
